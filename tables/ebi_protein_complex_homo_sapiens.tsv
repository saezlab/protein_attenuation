Role as a negative regulator of the hedgehog-signalling network and plays a fundamental role in the control of development, cell proliferation and differentiation.	GLI binding causes major conformational changes in SUFU, stabilizing SUFU in a "closed" state. The "open" conformation of SUFU is promoted by Hedgehog signalling, when it dissociates from GLI.

Critical regulator of glucose use, storage and the hormonal control of metabolism. May also transport dehydroascorbic acid.	Tetrameric GLUTl is believed to comprise of two dimers of GLUTl (a pseudo-D2 symmetry). Conformationally active regions of each subunit are constrained, resulting in coupled isomerizations and an antiparallel arrangement of sugar binding sites. Thus each dimer of the tetramer presents one influx and one efflux site and, when one subunit isomerizes from an efflux to an influx conformation, the second must isomerize from an influx to an efflux conformation and vice versa.	Homotetramer	-	GLUT1 deficiency syndrome 2 (GLUT1DS2) [MIM:612126]: A clinically variable disorder characterized primarily by onset in childhood of paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia. The dyskinesia involves transient abnormal involuntary movements, such as dystonia and choreoathetosis, induced by exercise or exertion, and affecting the exercised limbs. Some patients may also have epilepsy, most commonly childhood absence epilepsy. Mild mental retardation may also occur. In some patients involuntary exertion-induced dystonic, choreoathetotic, and ballistic movements may be associated with macrocytic hemolytic anemia.|Epilepsy, idiopathic generalized 12 (EIG12) [MIM:614847]: A disorder characterized by recurring generalized seizures in the absence of detectable brain lesions and/or metabolic abnormalities. Generalized seizures arise diffusely and simultaneously from both hemispheres of the brain. Seizure types include juvenile myoclonic seizures, absence seizures, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. In some EIG12 patients seizures may remit with age.|Dystonia 9 (DYT9) [MIM:601042]: An autosomal dominant neurologic disorder characterized by childhood onset of paroxysmal choreoathetosis and progressive spastic paraplegia. Most patients show some degree of cognitive impairment. Other variable features may include seizures, migraine headaches, and ataxia.|GLUT1 deficiency syndrome 1 (GLUT1DS1) [MIM:606777]: A neurologic disorder showing wide phenotypic variability. The most severe 'classic' phenotype comprises infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathy associated with delayed development, acquired microcephaly, motor incoordination, and spasticity. Onset of seizures, usually characterized by apneic episodes, staring spells, and episodic eye movements, occurs within the first 4 months of life. Other paroxysmal findings include intermittent ataxia, confusion, lethargy, sleep disturbance, and headache. Varying degrees of cognitive impairment can occur, ranging from learning disabilities to severe mental retardation.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

This is achieved by oxidizing ubiquinol (ubihydroquinone) which reacts from the membrane phase, reducing cytochrome c in the intermembrane space, and using the free energy change to transport H+ ions across the membrane from the matrix to the inter membrane space. Quinol oxidation occurs in a bifurcated reaction, in which one electron is transferred to a high potential chain and the other to a low potential chain. The high potential chain, consisting of the iron sulfur protein, cyt c1 and cyt c2, transfers the first electron from quinol to an acceptor (cytochrome oxidase).

Additional features may include headache, seizures, gradual personality changes (apathy and dementia), anosmia, impaired vision, exophthalmos, hearing loss, ataxia, dysmetria, hypotonia, nystagmus, and rarely spontaneous bleeding.|Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) [Orphanet:31112]: a rare infiltrating soft tissue sarcoma, generally of low grade malignancy, arising from the dermis of the skin and characteristically associated with a specific chromosomal translocation t(17;22). DFSP can present at any age, including infancy and childhood, but usually presents in the 2nd to 5th decade of life. Between 85 and 90% of tumors are low grade lesions, with the remainder classified as the high grade fibrosarcomatous (FS) type. The lesions typically present as an indurated pink or violet-red plaque or nodular mass on the trunk, proximal extremities, or head and neck region. Growth tends to be slow with local infiltration into deeper tissues and a propensity for local recurrence after excision. However, metastases are rare. Occurrence is sporadic.|Bilateral striopallidodentate calcinosis (Idiopathic basal ganglia calcification) [Orphanet:1980]: Bilateral striopallidodentate calcinosis (BSPDC, also erroneously called Fahr disease) is characterized by the accumulation of calcium deposits in different brain regions, particularly the basal ganglia and dentate nucleus, and is often associated with neurodegeneration.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

Homodimer	-	Meningioma [Orphanet:2495]: a mostly benign primary tumor of the meninges (arachnoid cap cells), usually located in the supratentorial compartment, commonly appearing in the sixth and seventh decade of life, clinically silent in most cases or causing hyperostosis close to the tumor and resulting in focal bulging and localized pain in less than 10% of cases. Additional features may include headache, seizures, gradual personality changes (apathy and dementia), anosmia, impaired vision, exophthalmos, hearing loss, ataxia, dysmetria, hypotonia, nystagmus, and rarely spontaneous bleeding.|Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) [Orphanet:31112]: a rare infiltrating soft tissue sarcoma, generally of low grade malignancy, arising from the dermis of the skin and characteristically associated with a specific chromosomal translocation t(17;22). DFSP can present at any age, including infancy and childhood, but usually presents in the 2nd to 5th decade of life. Between 85 and 90% of tumors are low grade lesions, with the remainder classified as the high grade fibrosarcomatous (FS) type. The lesions typically present as an indurated pink or violet-red plaque or nodular mass on the trunk, proximal extremities, or head and neck region. Growth tends to be slow with local infiltration into deeper tissues and a propensity for local recurrence after excision. However, metastases are rare. Occurrence is sporadic.|Bilateral striopallidodentate calcinosis (Idiopathic basal ganglia calcification) [Orphanet:1980]: Bilateral striopallidodentate calcinosis (BSPDC, also erroneously called Fahr disease) is characterized by the accumulation of calcium deposits in different brain regions, particularly the basal ganglia and dentate nucleus, and is often associated with neurodegeneration.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

DNA-binding is ATP-dependent, however specific DNA sequences that define origins of replication have not yet been identified. ORC recruits CDC6 and CDT1 to promote the loading of the MCM2-7 mini-chromosome maintenance complex (EBI-913604) onto chromatin to form the pre-replication complex necessary to initiate DNA replication. ORC is dynamically assembled and disassembled during the cell cycle. The complex is formed in an ATP-dependent manner at the exit from anaphase of mitosis and the complex binds to chromatin in an ORC1-dependent manner.

The BBSome complex is required for ciliogenesis but is dispensable for centriolar satellite function. This ciliogenic function is mediated in part by the Rab8 GDP/GTP exchange factor, which localizes to the basal body and contacts the BBSome. RAB8(GTP) enters the primary cilium and promotes extension of the ciliary membrane. Firstly the BBSome associates with the ciliary membrane and binds to RAB3IP/RABIN8, the guanosyl exchange factor (GEF) for RAB8 and then the RAB8-GTP localizes to the cilium and promotes docking and fusion of carrier vesicles to the base of the ciliary membrane. The BBSome complex, together with the LTZL1, controls SMO ciliary trafficking and contributes to the sonic hedgehog pathway regulation.	The apparent molecular weight of the BBSome (438 kDa) calculated from its measured Stokes radius (78 A) and sedimentation coefficient (14 S) is in close agreement with its predicted molecular weight of 470 kDa.	-	-	Ciliopathy [EFO:0003900]: Ciliary dysfunction leads to a broad spectrum of disorders, collectively termed ciliopathies.

Following the depolarization of the transverse tubule (T-tubule) membrane, RyR2 opening releases Ca2+ stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) into the myoplasm. This increase of cytoplasmic Ca2+ triggers the interaction of actin and myosin that causes contraction of the cardiac muscle fibers. The E-C coupling in cardiac muscle involves RyR2 calcium release triggered by Ca2+ influx due to activation of the L-type calcium channel Cav1.2 (EBI-9687812). RyR2 is required for heart development. Aberrant channel activation can lead to cardiac arrhythmia. RyR2 is also shown to play a role in beta cell survival in vitro. RyR2 physically interacts with various other proteins, small molecules and ions that modulate its activity: Low Ca+2 concentration activates RyR2, by binding to specific high-affinity Ca+2 sites. High Ca+2 concentration inhibits RyR2, by binding to less specific low-affinity Ca+2 sites. PKA binds to RyR2 altering the gating. S100A1 binding enhances the open probability of RyR2. ASPH and ATP stimulates RyR2 channel activity. Magnesium ions (Mg+2) inhibits the RyR2 channel activity. Homer-1c binding inhibits RyR2 channel opening. Calmodulin binding may inhibit open basal probability and alter the Ca-dependent activation of RyR2. FKBP binding is believed to physically stabilize the coordinated gating of the four RyRs in one RyR homotetramer and may be involved in the physical coupling between RyR tetramers. Binding to sorcin decreases open channel probability. CaMKIId binds and phosphorylates RyR2 strongly activating Ca2+ release during both diastole and systole.	The functional form of the Ryr2 calcium channel is a 30 S homotetramer of negatively charged and cooperatively coupled subunits of high molecular weight. MW (tetramer) > 2MDa The calcium release channel activity resides in the C-terminal region while the remaining part of the protein constitutes the foot structure spanning the junctional gap between the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and the T-tubule. The basic architecture can be described as a mushroom, with a large cup representing ~80% of the volume located in the cytoplasm and the stalk crossing the membrane into the SR/ER lumen. The large cytoplasmic domain is the site of interactions with a large number of the modulators of channel activity. Specifically, the corners of the cytoplasmic area, also called clamps, are the sites of interactions with modulators. RyRs are arrayed in the SR and the clamps are likely to participate in intermolecular interactions with neighbouring RyRs. The large cytoplasmic domain is also the site of mutations that underlie the RyR channelopathies.

Linked via G-proteins to potassium channels. Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates the activity of down-stream effectors, such as adenylate cyclase. Signaling inhibits adenylate cyclase, stimulates phospholipase A2, activates potassium channels, inactivates voltage-dependent calcium-channels and modulates inositol phospholipid hydrolysis. Calcium is required for high affinity binding to GABA. Plays a critical role in the fine-tuning of inhibitory synaptic transmission. Pre-synaptic GABA receptor inhibits neurotransmitter release by down-regulating high-voltage activated calcium channels, whereas postsynaptic GABA receptor decreases neuronal excitability by activating a prominent inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) conductance that underlies the late inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. Not only implicated in synaptic inhibition but also in hippocampal long-term potentiation, slow wave sleep, muscle relaxation and antinociception.	In the apo state and antagonist-bound state the two subunits only bind via their respective LB1 domains keeping the dimer in the open, inactive conformation. Antagonists bind almost exclusively to the LB1 domain of the GABBR1 subunit. In contrast, agonist binding occurs between the LB1 and LB2 domains of the GABBR1 subunit. It induces large conformational changes in the dimer resulting in domain closure of the ligand binding site of GABBR1 and inter-subunit binding via both, the LB1 and LB2 domains of either subunit. GABBR1 residues Trp65 and His170 are indispensible for ligand binding while Tyr250 and Trp278 are critical for agonist binding only. GABBR2 mediates coupling to G proteins probably via the linker region between the transmembrane domain 3 (TM3) and the transmembrane domain 4 (TM4). Homodimers of either subunit may form, but are inactive.

Following the depolarization of the transverse tubule (T-tubule) membrane, RyR1 opening releases Ca2+ stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) into the myoplasm. This increase of cytoplasmic Ca2+ triggers the interaction of actin and myosin that causes contraction of the muscle fibers. Implicated in skeletal muscle development, ossification, dermatogenesis and cardiovascular development. Expressed in the brain, where it can mediate the NO-induced release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores in neurons. The E-C coupling involves the mechanical interaction between RyR1 in the SR and DHPR (also known as L-type Ca2+ channel, EBI-9686737) in the T-tubule. There is some evidence to suggest that this happens through the direct physical interaction of the two channels. FKBP12 binds and co-purifies with RyR1, but the intrinsic isomerase activity is not essential for RyR effects. FKBP is believed to physically stabilize the coordinated gating of the four RyRs in one RyR homotetramer and may be involved in the physical coupling between RyR tetramers. RyR1 physically interacts with various other proteins, small molecules and ions that modulate its activity: Low Ca+2 concentration activates RyR1, by binding to specific high-affinity Ca+2 sites. High Ca+2 concentration inhibits RyR1, by binding to less specific low-affinity Ca+2 sites. S100A1 binds speciﬁcally to the puriﬁed RyR1 in a Ca2+ dependent manner, at regions overlapping with CaM binding sites, and enhances the open probability of RyR1 reconstituted in lipid bilayers. TRDN, ASPH, CACNA1S, Homer-1 and ATP stimulates RyR1 channel activity. Calmodulin with bound calcium inhibits the RYR1 channel activity, as is binding to magnesium ions (Mg+2).	The functional form of the Ryr1 calcium channel is a 30 S homotetramer of negatively charged and cooperatively coupled subunits of high molecular weight. There is in vitro evidence for homodimer and homotrimer formation, but no evidence for functional relevance of these complexes. MW (tetramer) = 2.2MDa The calcium release channel activity resides in the C-terminal region while the remaining part of the protein constitutes the foot structure spanning the junctional gap between the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and the T-tubule. The basic architecture can be described as a mushroom, with a large cup representing ~80% of the volume located in the cytoplasm and the stalk crossing the membrane into the SR/ER lumen. The large cytoplasmic domain is the site of interactions with a large number of the modulators of channel activity. Specifically, the corners of the cytoplasmic area, also called clamps, are the sites of interactions with modulators. RyRs are arrayed in the SR and the clamps are likely to participate in intermolecular interactions with neighbouring RyRs. The large cytoplasmic domain is also the site of mutations that underlie the RyR channelopathies.

The disease can be classified into clinical subtypes of increasing severity: silent alpha thalassemia, alpha thalassemia trait (or alpha thalassemia minor), hemoglobin H disease (HbH, [Orphanet:93616]), and Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis [Orphanet:163596]. A rare form called alpha-thalassemia-intellectual deficit syndrome linked to chromosome 16 (16p13.3) has also been identified. Alpha thalassemia trait causes microcytosis and hypochromia with absent or mild anemia (often detected on routine blood tests), generally with no other symptoms. HbH patients develop moderate hemolytic anemia with variable amounts of HbH along with occasionally severe splenomegaly, sometimes complicated by hypersplenism. Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis involves a severe deficiency in alpha-globin with serious developmental implications. Alpha-thalassemia-intellectual deficit syndrome is characterized by very mild to severe anemia associated with developmental abnormalities.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

Onset generally occurs from 6-24 months of age. Patients require regular transfusions. 3) Thalassemia intermedia (BTI) in which the anemia is less severe and diagnosed later in life compared to BT-major. Patients with BTI may or may not require occasional transfusions.

The presence of fetal hemoglobin means that the disease doesn't manifest until after 3 months. In addition to anemia and bacterial infections, VOAs cause hyperalgic focal ischemia (and sometimes infarction) when they occur in the muscles or skeleton. Over the course of time, VOAs may compromise the integrity of tissues or organs. Transmission is autosomal recessive. Sickle cell anemia is determined by combinations of two abnormal alleles of the beta globin gene among which at least one carries the beta 6 glu-val mutation (Hb S).

It relays an excitatory depolarization in the t-tubular membrane to the calcium release channel in the sarcoplasmatic membrane. More specifically, rapid depolarization-induced conformational changes of DHPR stimulate calcium efflux from the sarcoplasmatic reticulum (SR) through the calcium release channel (CRC, or ryanodine receptor, RyR, EBI-9638199), which subsequently trigger the contractile apparatus until the calcium concentration is reduced again due to re-uptake into the SR by the Ca2+-ATPase (Serca1). Expressed in cardiac muscle, smooth muscle (blood vessels, intestine, lung and uterus), endocrine cells (pancreatic beta cells, pituitary) and neurons (preferentially somatodendritic).	Total molecular mass of 540 kDa. Multisubunit complex formed by the alpha-1C subunit, in association with the soluble beta polypeptide, localized to the intracellular side of the plasma membrane and a largely extracellular alpha2/delta subunit. The complex is comprised of two distinct portions, a heart-shaped body and a 'finger' domain extending from a density at the tip ('nose') of the body domain. The channel activity is directed by the pore-forming and voltage-sensitive alpha-1 subunit. Alpha1C subunit consists of four conserved domains (I-IV) with six transmembrane segments (S1-S6) each. These domains are thought to be arranged in a pseudo-tetrameric structure. The S4 segment serves as the voltage sensor. The pore loop between transmembrane segments S5 and S6 in each domain determines ion conductance and selectivity. The alpha1 subunit I–II loop and alpha interaction domain (AID) interacts directly with the beta subunit, which is located on the intracellular side of the channel, facing the ryanodine receptor (RyR) complexes (RyR2: EBI-9638199). The beta subunit has a role in regulating activation, inactivation and voltage-dependence as well as targeting the alpha 1C domain to the plasma membrane. The alpha 2 and delta 1 subunits are two proteolytic fragments of one polypeptide coded by the same gene, which are linked together with a disulpide bond to produce the alpha 2/delta subunit of the Cav1.2 channel. The small delta subunit consists of a single membrane-spanning helix. Calmodulin binds to the Q motif of alpha1C subunit and acts as a Ca2+ sensor. Ca(2+)/CaM mediates a negative feedback regulation of the channel. CaBP1 eliminates this action of CaM through a poorly understood mechanism.

In response to TGF-beta/activin-family protein binding, TGF-beta type II receptors phosphorylate TGF-beta type I receptors (ALK4, 5 and 7) which in turn phosphorylates SMAD2 on two Ser-465 and Ser-467. This enables binding to SMAD4 to form heteromeric SMAD complexes that enter the nucleus to initiate gene transcription. Because of their relatively low DNA-binding affinity, SMAD complexes interact with a wide variety of DNA-binding proteins, crosstalk with other signalling pathways and interaction with other DNA-binding cofactors define the specific binding patterns of SMADs; in addition, interaction with coactivators/corepressors modulates their transcriptional activity.	Preferential formation of the regulatory R-Smad/SMAD4 heterotrimer over the R-Smad homotrimer is largely enthalpy driven, contributed by the unique presence of strong electrostatic interactions within the heterotrimeric interfaces. These electrostatic interactions exist only in the heterotrimer due to specific charged residues in the SMAD4 subunit, Asp-493 and Arg-378, mediating complementary electrostatic interactions with the neighbouring R-Smad subunits.

The Mediator complex is also targeted by sequence-specific, DNA-binding transcription factors and appears to regulate RNAPII at both the initiation and elongation stages of transcription. The Mediator complex, having a compact conformation in its free form, is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and unfolds to an extended conformation and partially surrounds RNAPII specifically interacting with the unphosphorylated form of its C-terminal domain. The Mediator complex dissociates from the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme and stays at the promoter when transcriptional elongation begins. Reversibly associates with the CKM complex (EBI-9817251, EBI-9844402). Mediator lacking the CKM complex has a stimulatory effect on basal transcription. In contrast, Mediator containing the sub-complex represses basal transcription.	Molecular weight = >1 MDa.

Three main types of BT have been described (minor, intermedia [Orphanet:231222] and major [Orphanet:231214]). 1) Thalassemia minor (BT-minor, BT trait) is the heterozygous form and is usually asymptomatic. 2) Thalassemia major (Cooley anemia; BT-major) is the homozygous form and associates splenomegaly and microcytic and hypochromic anemia resulting from dyserythropoiesis and hemolysis. Onset generally occurs from 6-24 months of age. Patients require regular transfusions. 3) Thalassemia intermedia (BTI) in which the anemia is less severe and diagnosed later in life compared to BT-major. Patients with BTI may or may not require occasional transfusions. Rare autosomal dominant forms have also been described (dominant beta-thalassemia [Orphanet:231226]) resulting in moderate to severe anemia. Transmission is autosomal recessive and around 200 mutations (B0 or B+) have been identified.|Sickle cell anemia [Orphanet:232]: a chronic hemolytic diseases that may induce three types of acute accidents: severe anemia, severe bacterial infections, and ischemic vasoocclusive accidents (VOA) caused by sickle-shaped red blood cells obstructing small blood vessels and capillaries. The presence of fetal hemoglobin means that the disease doesn't manifest until after 3 months. In addition to anemia and bacterial infections, VOAs cause hyperalgic focal ischemia (and sometimes infarction) when they occur in the muscles or skeleton. Over the course of time, VOAs may compromise the integrity of tissues or organs. Transmission is autosomal recessive. Sickle cell anemia is determined by combinations of two abnormal alleles of the beta globin gene among which at least one carries the beta 6 glu-val mutation (Hb S). Sickle cell anemia reduces the susceptibility to malaria infection.|Alpha-thalassemia [Orphanet:846]: Alpha-thalassemia is an inherited hemoglobinopathy characterized by impaired synthesis of alpha-globin chains leading to a variable clinical picture depending on the number of affected alleles. The disease can be classified into clinical subtypes of increasing severity: silent alpha thalassemia, alpha thalassemia trait (or alpha thalassemia minor), hemoglobin H disease (HbH, [Orphanet:93616]), and Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis [Orphanet:163596]. A rare form called alpha-thalassemia-intellectual deficit syndrome linked to chromosome 16 (16p13.3) has also been identified. Alpha thalassemia trait causes microcytosis and hypochromia with absent or mild anemia (often detected on routine blood tests), generally with no other symptoms. HbH patients develop moderate hemolytic anemia with variable amounts of HbH along with occasionally severe splenomegaly, sometimes complicated by hypersplenism. Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis involves a severe deficiency in alpha-globin with serious developmental implications. Alpha-thalassemia-intellectual deficit syndrome is characterized by very mild to severe anemia associated with developmental abnormalities.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

Mediates the sedative, anterograde amnestic and in part anticonvulsant actions of diazepam. Isoform 1 and isoform 2 of GABRB2 show reduced expression in schizophrenic brain. Isoform 3 shows increased expression in schizophrenic and bipolar disorder brains while isoform 4 shows reduced expression.	Probable stoichiometry: 2xalpha1 - 2xbeta2 - 1xgamma2. The gamma2 subunit carries the benzodiazepine binding site. Evidence for the existence and conformation of the diverse GABA-A receptors relies on localisation and pharmacological studies so conformation is based on cumulative evidence and comparison with related ligand-gated ion channel families (e.g. nicotinic acetylcholine receptors).

It relays an excitatory depolarization in the T-tubular membrane to the calcium release channel in the sarcoplasmatic membrane. More specifically, rapid depolarization-induced conformational changes of DHPR stimulate calcium efflux from the sarcoplasmatic reticulum (SR) through the calcium release channel (CRC, or ryanodine receptor, RyR [RyR1: EBI-9632656, RyR3: EBI-9663146]), which subsequently trigger the contractile apparatus until the calcium concentration is reduced again due to re-uptake into the SR by the Ca2+-ATPase (Serca1). Small calcium currents through the DHPR are activated slowly and are not sufficient to trigger muscle contraction in skeletal muscle. It is widely accepted that physical coupling accounts for the close functional coupling between the DHPR and the RyR in skeletal muscle. So far the exact mechanism of EC coupling is not fully understood.	Total molecular mass ~ 550 kDa. Multisubunit complex formed by the alpha-1C subunit, in association with the soluble beta polypeptide, localized to the intracellular side of the plasma membrane, a largely extracellular alpha2/delta subunit on the T-tubule side of the channel and an intracellular gamma subunit. The channel activity is directed by the pore-forming and voltage-sensitive alpha-1 subunit. Alpha1C subunit consists of four conserved domains (I-IV) with six transmembrane segments (S1-S6) each. These domains are thought to be arranged in a pseudo-tetrameric structure. The S4 segment serves as the voltage sensor. The pore loop between transmembrane segments S5 and S6 in each domain determines ion conductance and selectivity. The alpha1 subunit I–II loop and alpha interaction domain (AID) interacts directly with the beta subunit, which is located on the intracellular side of the channel facing the ryanodine receptor (RyR) complexes (RyR1: EBI-9632656, RyR3:EBI-9663146). The alpha2 and delta subunits are linked by a disulphide bridge and the small delta subunit consists of a single membrane-spanning helix. The gamma subunit is membrane-embedded and can either be located in the small or in the large sub-volume of the globular domain. The gamma1 subunit has been shown to associate with the alpha1 subunit in recent co-sedimentation experiments. The complex contains a globular domain in the shape of an ellipsoid and a protrusion that is leg-shaped and attached off-center on one of the flat sides of the globular domain. The protrusion is identified as the alpha2 subunit.	Heteropentamer	-	Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic disorder of skeletal muscle that presents as a hypermetabolic response to potent volatile anesthetic gases such as halothane, sevoflurane, desflurane and the depolarizing muscle relaxant succinylcholine, and rarely in humans, to stresses such as vigorous exercise and heat. The classic signs of MH include marked hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, increased carbon dioxide production, increased oxygen consumption, acidosis, muscle rigidity and rhabdomyolysis, all of which are related to a hypermetabolic response. In humans, the syndrome is inherited in autosomal dominant pattern.|Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP) is characterised by episodes of muscle paralysis lasting from a few to 24-48 hours and associated with a fall in blood potassium levels. Prevalence is estimated at around 1 in 100,000. The paralysis most often affects the four limbs, thus resulting in tetraplegia. Principle triggering factors include meals rich in carbohydrates and rest after exercise. Around 70% of cases are associated with mutations in the muscle calcium channel gene CACNA1S.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

A cation-specific, but otherwise relatively non-selective, ion channel with low conductance. Ca2+-permeability is related to subunit composition with 5HT3A homopentamers being more permeable than 5HT3A/B heteropentamers. Found pre- and post-synaptically but with different properties - pre-synaptic 5-HT3 receptors are predominantly calcium-permeant while post-synaptic receptors are permeant to Na+ and K+. Also Mg2+ permeant. Pre-synaptic depolarisations are generally slower than post-synaptic depolarisations. 5-HT3 receptors increase the frequency of spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs) or miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs). These may be related to 5-HT3-induced depolarisation of pre-synaptic membranes and subsequent activation of cholinergic or glutamatergic neurotransmissions or evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents (eEPSCs) or spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSCs) related to GABAergic neurotransmissions post-synaptic 5-HT3 receptor activation. Due to different residues in transmembrane domain M2 of the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits the 5-HT3A/B heteromeric receptors are more efficient conductors than 5-HT3A homomeric receptors and have increased agonist and antagonist affinity. Homomeric receptors recover faster from desensitisation but are probably less prevalent in vivo. High levels of expression are found in the vagal terminals of the dorsal vagal complex where it is involved in the vomiting reflex (especially post-operative and chemotherapy- and radiation-induced vomiting and nausea), in the amygdala and the hippocampi. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists therefore act as effective anti-emetic drugs. Lower levels of expression are found in the forebrain with higher relative expression in the striatum than the cortical regions. Involved in processes associated with emotion, cognition, memory and pain perception. Involved in ganglionic transmission in the myenteric plexus in the mucosal layer and expressed in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract where serotonin mediates control over a variety of physiological functions such as the contraction/relaxation of smooth muscle, and peristaltic and secretory reflexes, directly or indirectly through intrinsic primary afferent neurons. Plays an important role in the regulation of inflammation and immune responses in the peripheral nervous system. Activation of 5-HT3 receptors on visceral afferents in some irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients results in visceral hypersensitivity. Chaperone proteins assist assembly, modifications and export from the ER followed by transport in vesicle-like structures along microtubules to the plasma membrane where they typically form clusters in F-actin-rich regions.	Pentamer that forms a central channel. Each subunit consists of a large, N-terminal, extracellular domain, four transmembrane (TM) domains (M1-M4), of which M2 lines the channel, as well as intra- and extracellular loops connecting the TM domains and an extracellular C-terminus. Cation selectivity is determined by the M2 TM domain as well as the cytoplasmic M3-M4 loop while conductance efficiency is related to residues in the M3-M4 loop. The 5-HT3A subunits, at least, are N-glycosylated and phosphorylated in the cytoplasmic M3-M4 loop. The 5-HT3A subunit exists as different splice variants in different mammalian species, some of which are only functional in complex with canonical chains. In the 5-HT3A/B heteromer, the 5-HT3A shields the ER-retention signal of the 5-HT3B subunit allowing export of the heteromeric complex from the ER to the plasma membrane.	-	serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, CHEBI:28790)	Schizophrenia [EFO:0000692]: A severe emotional disorder of psychotic depth characteristically marked by a retreat from reality with delusion formation, HALLUCINATIONS, emotional disharmony, and regressive behaviour.|Depression [EFO:0003761]: Severe mental disorder with onset in MIDDLE AGE, marked by withdrawl, abnormal affect, disturbed intellectual processes, and there may be regression.|Bipolar disorder [EFO:0000289]: A major affective disorder marked by severe mood swings (manic or major depressive episodes) and a tendency to remission and recurrence.|Post-operative nausea and vomiting [EFO:0004888]: Emesis and queasiness occurring after anesthesia.|Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting [EFO:0006911]: Emesis and queasiness occurring after chemotherapy.|Radiation-induced nausea and vomiting [EFO:0006912]: Emesis and queasiness occurring after radiotherapy.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

Activated under low extracellular sodium concentrations and self-inhibited by high extracellular sodium concentrations. Activation is dependent on proteolytic cleavage of alpha and gamma subunits, post-translational modifications (such as glycosylation of beta subunit and palmitoylation) and possibly cyclic nucleotides that lift self-inhibition. Regulated by hormones such as aldosterone and vasopressin and inhibited by the diuretic amiloride. Although the channel activity itself is not voltage-gated, ameloride-sensitivity may be voltage-dependent. Channel gating and conductance are comparatively slow. Plays an essential role in electrolyte and blood pressure homeostasis, but also in airway surface liquid (ASL) homeostasis, which is important for proper clearance of mucus and pathogens. Mutations leading to a loss of ASL homeostatis are a trigger for cystic fibrosis. The inward sodium transport may trigger action potentials in neurons by gradually depolarizing membrane potentials. In nephrons may also be activated by shear stress potentially changing the conformation of the bulky extracellular loop or the transmembrane domains and thereby increasing channel opening times. May also play a role in salt and sour taste perception. Found in the apical membrane of many epithelial cell types, especially in the Aldosterone Sensitive Distal Nephron (ASDN), kidney, colon, lung and sweat glands but also in heart, liver, pancreas, skeletal muscle and blood leukocytes. Also expressed in vascular endothelia where their mechanical properties and function differ from epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) in other tissues: vascular endothelia are ‘leaky’, allowing passive sodium transport through the membrane. Here, ENaCs are activated by increased external sodium concentrations that enhances the sodium influx into the cell. May stabilize F-actin through strengthening of the inter-subunits causing swelling or stiffening of endothelia and which can ultimately lead to hypertension. 	The stoichiometry is uncertain and could be heterotrimeric, heterohexameric, heterononameric with equal ratios for the three subunits or heterotetrameric with alpha-beta-gamma ratio of 2:1:1. The beta and gamma subunits regulate the channel activity and the alpha subunit regulates channel conductance. Transmembrane domain (TM) 1 lines the plasma membrane, TM2 lines the channel. 	-	-	Pseudohypoaldosteronism type I (PHA1) [Orphanet:756]: a primary form of mineralocorticoid resistance presenting in the newborn with renal salt wasting, failure to thrive and dehydration. Caused by beta subunit loss of function mutation leading to decreased blood pressure.|Liddle syndrome (LIDDS) [Orphanet:526]: a rare, autosomal dominant form of hypertension characterized by pseudoaldosteronism with hypokalemic alkalosis and severe early-onset hypertension associated with decreased plasmatic levels of potassium, renin and aldosterone. Caused by truncations of or mutation in PY motif of beta or gamma subunits leading to constitutive activation of the renal epithelial sodium channel. The PY motif contains the E3 ligase interaction site that is essential for the ubiquination and degradation of subunits. Constitutive activation of the epithelial sodium channel can also be caused by high dietary salt intake or excessive licorice consumption.|Hypertension [EFO:0000537]: persistently high systemic arterial blood pressure. Based on multiple readings, hypertension is currently defined as when systolic pressure is consistently greater than 140 mm Hg or when diastolic pressure is consistently 90 mm Hg or more. Loss of epithelial sodium channel self-inhibition activity under high sodium conditions leads to salt-sensitive hypertension [MP:0004217]: sustained high blood pressure that is maintained with the amount of salt consumed in the diet; blood pressure may return to normotensive with a low salt diet.|Cystic fibrosis (CF) [Orphanet:586]: an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the production of sweat with a high salt content and mucus secretions with an abnormal viscosity due to airway surface liquid (ASL) dehydration. As the mucus traps particles and pathogens a lack of regular mucus clearance in patients can lead to serious lung infections. The disease is chronic and generally progressive, with onset usually occurring during early childhood or, occasionally, at birth (meconium ileus). Virtually any internal organ may be involved but the principle manifestations concern the breathing apparatus (chronic bronchitis), pancreas (pancreatic insufficiency, adolescent diabetes and occasionally pancreatitis) and, more rarely, the intestine (stercoral obstruction) or liver (cirrhosis). The most common form of cystic fibrosis is associated with respiratory symptoms, digestive problems (steatorrhea and/or constipation), elevated sweat electrolytes and staturoponderal growth anomalies. Mortality and morbidity depend on the extent of bronchopulmonary involvement. Male sterility is a constant feature. Late-onset forms, which are usually only mild or monosymptomatic, have also been reported. Characterized by alterations in the CFTR protein (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, P13569). The absence of the CFTR in apical membranes causes epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) hyperactivity, excessive sodium absorption, ASL dehydration and acidification of the extracellular space leading to lung infections. SPLUNC1 negatively regulates ENaC activity and therefore maintains normal ASL homeostasis. Under ASL dehydration and acidic conditions this interaction is abolished.|Bronchiectasis [HP:0002110]: a bronchial disease that is a chronic inflammatory condition of one or more bronchi or bronchioles marked by dilatation and loss of elasticity of the walls resulting from damage to the airway wall leading to the formation of small sacs on the bronchial wall and impairment of cilia mobility in the lung. Inflammation of the bronchial wall increases mucus secretion which serves as a breeding ground for bacteria. Bronchiectasis is caused by repeated respiratory infections, immune deficiency disorders, hereditary disorders (cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary dyskinesia), mechanical factors (inhaled object or a lung tumor) or inhaling toxic substances.	-	amiloride (CHEBI:2639)|zinc ion (Zn2+, CHEBI:29105)	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

Predominantly cytoplasmic, in association with plasma membrane. The proteolytic variant p25-CDK5 (EBI-9633559) is nuclear.	Myristoylation on Gly2 regulates the membrane association of p35 and the N-terminal lysine cluster controls its trafficking to the plasma membrane. When p35 is not myristoylated, the Lys clusters appeared to function as nuclear localization signal (NLS).	Heterodimer	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

Activated by simultaneous binding of glycine to GluN1 and L-glutamate to GluN2. Blocked by physiological concentrations of extracellular magnesium which is released by membrane depolarization. Predominantly post-synaptic receptor that mediates mostly the late/slow phase of the majority of the fast excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian brain where it plays a key role in synaptic plasticity, synaptogenesis, excitotoxicity, memory acquisition and learning. Combinations of different receptor isoforms and their splice variants result in formation of ion channels with distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns and pharmacological and electrophysiological properties. Replacement of one or more subunits with GluN3A (Q8TCU5) or GluN3B (O60391) subunits results in relatively Ca2+-impermeable cation channels that are resistant to Mg2+. Dysfunctional NMDA receptors are implicated in various neurological disorders and injuries including depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, chronic and neuropathic pain, as well as neuronal loss following ischaemia or stroke.	Obligate heterotetramer formed around a central pore, with distinct domains that are arranged in parallel for all subunits. Topology of the N1/N2 units probably of 1-2-1-2 arrangement but some experiments suggest 1-1-2-2 arrangement. The GluN1 subunits occupy a proximal position, closer to the central axis of the channel pore than that of GluN2/N3 subunits. GluN1 and GluN3 bind allosteric activators glycine or D-serine and GluN2 binds allosteric activators L-glutamate or NMDA at the extracellular ligand-binding domain formed by the N1-N2/N3 heterodimers. NMDA mimicks the action of glutamate, specifically binds to GluN2 subunits and regulates the NMDA-type iGlu receptors only. Polyamines act as allosteric modulators by binding to the extracellular n-terminal domain (NTD). Zn2+ acts as an allosteric inhibitor by binding to the bilobed cleft of the NTD. H+ also acts as an allosteric inhibitor but its binding site remains uncertain. Mg2+ binds the "GluN2 S/L site" of the transmembrane domain.

A transmembrane channel specific for potassium and sensitive to voltage changes in the cell's membrane potential, composed of alpha and beta subunits. Alpha subunit (Kv4.2), is a potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily D member 2 protein. Beta subunit is an auxiliary, regulatory subunit, called Kv channel-interacting protein 2 (KChIP2) that modulates channel inactivation kinetics and rate of recovery from inactivation in a calcium-dependent manner. During action potentials, the channel plays a crucial role in returning the depolarized cell to a resting state (repolarisation phase). It contributes to the cardiac transient outward current I(TO) in the heart and the somatodendritic A-type current I(SA) in neurons.These currents operate at subthreshold membrane potentials to control the excitability of neurons and cardiac myocytes.	The Kv4.2-KChIP2 complex is composed of four (alpha) Kv4.2 and four (beta) KChIP2 subunits. The alpha subunit (encoded by the kcnd2 gene) has six membrane spans flanked by intracellular N- and C-terminal domains. The N-terminus of Kv4.2 interacts with the cytosolic KChIP2 subunits. The C-terminus of Kv4.2 is important for the channel gating. The four alpha subunits create a central, membrane spanning, ion conducting pathway. The KChIP2 domain has four EF-hand-like domains and binds calcium ions. Overall the complex is ~85 angstrom tall with two prominent domains.

A transmembrane channel specific for potassium and sensitive to voltage changes in the cell's membrane potential, composed of alpha and beta subunits. Alpha subunit (Kv4.3), is a potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily D member 3 protein. Beta subunit is an auxiliary, regulatory subunit, called Kv channel-interacting protein 1 (KChIP1) that modulates channels density, inactivation kinetics and rate of recovery from inactivation in a calcium-dependent manner. During action potentials, the channel plays a crucial role in returning the depolarized cell to a resting state (repolarisation phase). It contributes to the cardiac transient outward current I(TO) in the heart and the somatodendritic A-type current I(SA) in neurons.These currents operate at subthreshold membrane potentials to control the excitability of neurons and cardiac myocytes.	The Kv4.3-KChIP1 complex is composed of four (alpha) Kv4.3 and four (beta) KChIP1 subunits. The alpha subunit (encoded by the kcnd33 gene) has six membrane spans flanked by intracellular N- and C-terminal domains. The N-terminus of Kv4.3 interacts with the cytosolic KChIP1 subunits. One KChIP1 molecule binds to two neighbouring Kv4.3 N-termini, with two contact interfaces being involved in the interaction. This ‘molecular clamp’ is propagated four times, thereby stabilizing the tetramerization of Kv4.3 channels. The four alpha subunits create a central, membrane-spanning, ion-conducting pathway. The KChIP1 domain has four EF-hand-like domains and binds calcium ions.

The complex seems to be required for the inhibition of the reduction of the disulfide bonds of the heavy chains and the assembly and stabilization of the PLC, suggesting PDIA3/ERp57 may play a structural role rather than a catalytic one.	PDIA3 contains four thioredoxin-like domains.

There is a covalent bond between Cys-115 in this loop and Cys-57 in the PDIA3 catalytic motif. The fourth domain of PDIA3 (residues 406-409) forms an interface in the Ig-like portion of the TAPBP N-terminus.

The Kir2.1 channel is characterized by a strong inward rectification, in which K+ ions flow preferentially into rather than out of the cell. Their voltage dependence is regulated by the concentration of extracellular potassium; as external potassium is raised, the voltage range of the channel opening shifts to more positive voltages. Inward rectification is produced by cytosolic polyamines and Mg2+ occluding the ion conductance pathway as K+ ions are flowing outward. These positively charged particles are then removed from the pore when K+ ions flow into the cell. Rectification is the primary means of gating for Kir2 channels. In addition to rectification, another common feature of Kir channels is regulation by the membrane phospholipid PIP2. Opening of Kir channels requires PIP2 binding to basic and polar amino acids in the cytoplasmic domains, whereas depletion of PIP2 seems to close the channel. Expressed in brain, heart and skeletal muscle.	In addition to the homotetramer, KCNJ2 can form heterotetramers with other members of the Kir2 protein family.

This current is critical in correctly timing the return to the resting state (repolarization) of the cell membrane during the cardiac action potential. In the nervous system, the complex is mainly involved in regulating spike-frequency adaptation and controlling resting potential, and abnormal expression is associated with the onset of schizophrenia. The complex also participates in cell proliferation and differentiation, regulating apoptosis, and is involved in regulating the secretory activity of pancreatic beta cells and chromaffin cells, as well as in regulating the contractility of smooth-muscle cells in the portal vein, the jejunum, and the epididymal duct, possibly by regulating the excitability of these cells.	-	Heterooctamer	potassium ion (K+) (CHEBI:29103 )	Familial long QT syndrome (LQTS) [Orphanet:768]: a hereditary cardiac disease characterized by a prolongation of the QT interval at basal ECG and by a high risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. The two cardinal manifestations of LQTS are syncopal episodes, which may lead to cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death, and electrocardiographic abnormalities, including prolongation of the QT interval and T wave abnormalities. All the LQTS genes identified so far encode cardiac ion channel subunits or proteins involved in modulating ionic currents. Mutations in these genes (KCNQ1, KCNH2, KCNE1, KCNE2, CACNA1c, CAV3, SCN5A, SCN4B) cause the disease by prolonging the duration of the action potential. The prognosis of the disease is usually good in patients that are correctly diagnosed and treated. However, there are a few severe exceptions for patients with LQTS variants.|Familiar short QT syndrome (SQTS) [Orphanet:51083]: a cardiologic entity that associates a short QT interval (QT and QTc 300 ms) on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) with a high risk of syncope or sudden death due to malignant ventricular arrhythmia. This extremely rare syndrome affects mainly young adults or infants. The clinical spectrum is very wide ranging from asymptomatic carriers to syncope or sudden death. It is frequently associated with atrial fibrillation. Mutations in three different genes KCNQ1, KCNH2, and KCNJ2, all encoding cardiac ionic potassium channels have been identified in affected patients. Transmission is autosomal dominant. Expression studies have shown a gain of function and a shortening of the action potential duration, explaining the short QT interval.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

Regulates gene expression and cell proliferation by binding transcription factors such as Histone pThr12-H3, Oct-4 (Q01860), Stat3 (P40763), pTyr333-β-catenin (P35222). Often, but not always, phosphorylates the transcription factor using beta-d-fructofuranose 1,6-bisphosphate (CHEBI:28013) as phosphate donor. Nuclear translocation is induced by PIAS3-mediated sumoylation and ERK2-mediated phosphorylation on Ser-37. Redirects glucose-derived carbons towards biosynthesis, indirectly supporting the Warburg effect, by regulating gene expression in the nucleus. This switch is tightly controlled by oncogenes, tumor suppressors and growth signals and affected by post-translational modifications of PKM2. Important allosteric affectors for the dimeric state are human papilloma virus E7, promyelocytic leukemia (PML, P29590), EGFR-mediated-pY46-MUC1-C (P15941), phosphor-tyrosine proteins and SAICAR (succinyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-ribose-50-phosphate).

In response to TGF-beta/activin-family protein binding, TGF-beta type II receptors phosphorylate TGF-beta type I receptors (ALK4, 5 and 7) which in turn phosphorylates SMAD3 on two Ser-423 and Ser-425. This enables binding to SMAD4 to form heteromeric SMAD complexes that enter the nucleus to initiate gene transcription. Because of their relatively low DNA-binding affinity, SMAD complexes interact with a wide variety of DNA-binding proteins. Crosstalk with other signalling pathways and interaction with other DNA-binding cofactors define the specific binding patterns of SMADs; in addition, interaction with coactivators/corepressors modulates their transcriptional activity.	Preferential formation of the regulatory R-Smad/SMAD4 heterotrimer over the R-Smad homotrimer is largely enthalpy driven, contributed by the unique presence of strong electrostatic interactions within the heterotrimeric interfaces. These electrostatic interactions exist only in the heterotrimer due to specific charged residues in the SMAD4 subunit, Asp-493 and Arg-378, mediating complementary electrostatic interactions with the neighboring R-Smad subunits.

Binding of the ligand AMP in response to atrial distension (high blood volume) plays a major role in the regulation of blood pressure and salt-fluid volume homeostasis. Binding of ANP to ANPR-A dimer activates the receptor and stimulates its guanylate cyclase activity, thereby elevating intracellular cGMP levels. cGMP, in return mediates the hormonal actions through cGMP-regulated ion channels, protein kinases and phosphodiesterases. The end result is a reduction in blood volume and, therefore, a reduction in cardiac output and systemic blood pressure.	The ANPR-A dimer complex is composed of two ANPR-A molecules. The ANPR-A monomer has a membrane-distal and a membrane-proximal domain, each consisting of a central beta-sheet surrounded by alpha helices. The ANPR-A monomers form a head-to-head dimer through their membrane distal domains. The membrane-distal domains also bind chloride ions, necessary for ANP binding. ANP binding induces structural changes to the ANPR-A dimer. These involve a shift of the relative positions of the two ANPR-A monomers.

IKs is a major repolarization current in the heart that responds rapidly and robustly to sympathetic nervous system stimulation. Binding of beta subunit MinK (KCNE1) modifies the gating properties of the channel: it increases the single channel conductance, slows the rate of activation and removes (or greatly slows) inactivation of KCNQ1 alpha subunits.	KvLQT1 (or KCNQ1) is the alpha subunit and MinK (or KCNE1) the beta subunit of the channel. The two subunits coassemble to form heteromultimer channels, with unknown and probably varying stoichiometry. Based on other voltage-gated K+ channels it is assumed that four KCNQ1 alpha subunits coassemble to form the pore-forming unit, however specific structural evidence is lacking. Evidence suggests that more than one MinK subunit might interact with each KCNQ1 subunit. It is believed that KCNQ1 alpha subunits can also coassemble between them only, to form functional homomultimers, however the presence of MinK is required to reproduce the kinetic properties of the native IKs current.

CSNK1A1 phosphorylates CTNNB1 on Ser-45 and primes successive phosphorylation of Thr-41, Ser-37, and Ser-33 by GSK3. Phosphorylation of CTNNB1 promotes its subsequent ubiquitination which targets the protein for degradation by the proteasome. Without Wnt, Axin is also phosphorylated by GSK3, and thereby kept in an active (‘open’) conformation for beta-catenin binding and degradation. Upon Wnt stimulation, the ternary WNT-FZ-LRP6 complex is formed and recruits the scaffold protein DVL and the beta-catenin destruction complex.

CSNK1A1 phosphorylates CTNNB1 on Ser-45 and primes successive phosphorylation of Thr-41, Ser-37, and Ser-33 by GSK3. Phosphorylation of CTNNB1 promotes its subsequent ubiquitination which targets the protein for degradation by the proteasome. Without Wnt, Axin is also phosphorylated by GSK3, and thereby kept in an active (‘open’) conformation for beta-catenin binding and degradation. Upon Wnt stimulation, the ternary WNT-FZ-LRP6 complex is formed and recruits the scaffold protein DVL and the beta-catenin destruction complex. As a result, GSK3 is inhibited, CTNNB1 is not ubiquitinated and accumulates in the nucleus, where it acts as a coactivator for transcription factors of the TCF/LEF family, leading to activation of Wnt responsive genes.

Na+/K+ pumps can also generate an inward current of protons. Each transport cycle comprises a sequence of conformational transitions that permit extracellular K+ ions to access the binding sites in phosphorylated pumps and cytoplasmic Na+ ions to access the sites after dephosphorylation . Binding of the third Na+ ion triggers autophosphorylation, and binding of the second K+ ion prompts auto-dephosphorylation. This coupling of alternating ion access to ATP hydrolysis ensures forward, energetically uphill, progress of the Na+/K+ transport cycle. The larger pumped Na+ efflux than K+ influx constitutes outward current, a direction tending to make the membrane potential more negative. However, because each step in the cycle is reversible , if the normally transported intracellular Na+ and extracellular K+ are both scarce, the cycle can run backward, thus synthesizing ATP and generating inward, depolarizing current. 	The alpha subunit contains the Na+, K+ and ATP binding sites. The beta subunit is required for routing of the alpha subunit to the plasma membrane and for occlusion of the K+ ions. The gamma subunit regulates the pumping activity in a tissue- and isoform-specific way. Occlusion of K+ is vital for the stability of the complex.

Activated by binding of MgADP or MgATP to the nucleotide binding domains (NBD) of the ABCC9/SUR2A subunit as well as extracellular K+ binding to the KCNJ11/Kir6.2 subunit. If MgATP binds it must first get hydrolised by the ATP hydrolysis activity of the NBD which also generates PtdIns(4,5)P2 from phosphatidylinositol. Channel activation possibly driven by conformational changes resulting from MgADP binding to SUR subunits and reducing ATP affinity to Kir6.2. Inhibited by intracellular ATP or ADP, Mg2+ and polyamines that bind to the Kir6.2 subunits. ATP/ADP probably changes the conformation of Kir6.2 while Mg2+ and polyamines physically block the flow of K+ through the channel pore. Also inhibited by exogenous sulfonylureas by binding to intracellular loops (possibly by displacing MgADP from NBDs). As ATP is a weak inhibitor Kir6.2 channels can open spontaneously and are classified as constitutively active ion channels. In the absence of ATP (but presence of MgATP), cardiac channels exhibit spontaneous bursts of rapid openings and closings (fast kinetics), which are separated by long closed intervals (slow kinetics). Conversely, ATP destabilizes channel open state and stabilizes its closed states by increasing the speed of gating. Found predominantly in cardiac smooth muscle, skeletal muscle smooth muscle, neurons and ovaries. Gating of the atrial K+ channel is mechanosensitive, and mechanical pressure applied to a cardiac cell leads to an increase in their activity.	The four Kir6.2/KCNJ11 subunits form the K+ channel with the ABCC9/SUR2A subunits attached round the outside of the channel by interaction of their respective N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic loops. These form a beta sheet that acts as a gating regulator. There are three different SUR subunits, SUR1 (ABCC8), SUR2A and SUR2B (ABCC9 isoforms 1 and 2).

Required for the elongation of isolation membranes (phagophores). Acts as an E3-like enzyme to recruit the E2-like protein ATG3, conjugated to LC3-I, to the endoplasmic reticulum-derived omegasome. ATG3 binds to and is activated by ATG12, facilitating conjugation of the LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine, thus converting LC3-I to LC3-II. Therefore, the site of ATG12–ATG5-ATG16L1 complex recruitment determines the site of LC3-II formation. The LC3 family is required for phagophore expansion, closure, and cargo recruitment.	ATG12 is constitutively conjugated to ATG5, via a glycyl-lysine isopeptide. Formation of the complex is mediated by ATG16L1 homo-oligomerization. Additionally ATG16L1 contains repeat WD40 domains, which facilitate the conjugation of LC3s to PE by recruiting other autophagic components onto the phagophore membrane and forming an approximately 800-kDa oligomeric complex, sedimentation studies suggest a 1:1 stoichiometry for ATG16L1 to ATG12-ATG5. Several isoforms exist for ATG16L1 the distribution of which may be tissue-dependent. 	-	-	Associated with Crohn's Disease [EFO:0000384], a chronic transmural inflammation that may involve any part of the digestive tract from mouth to anus, mostly found in the ileum, the cecum, and the colon.

Activated by binding of MgADP or MgATP to the nucleotide binding domains (NBD) of the ABCC9/SUR2A subunit as well as extracellular K+ binding to the KCNJ11/Kir6.2 subunit. If MgATP binds it must first get hydrolised by the ATP hydrolysis activity of the NBD which also generates PtdIns(4,5)P2 from phosphatidylinositol. Channel activation possibly driven by conformational changes resulting from MgADP binding to SUR subunits and reducing ATP affinity to Kir6.2. Inhibited by intracellular ATP or ADP, Mg2+ and polyamines that bind to the Kir6.2 subunits. ATP/ADP probably changes the conformation of Kir6.2 while Mg2+ and polyamines physically block the flow of K+ through the channel pore. Also inhibited by exogenous sulfonylureas by binding to intracellular loops (possibly by displacing MgADP from NBDs). As ATP is a weak inhibitor Kir6.2 channels can open spontaneously and are classified as constitutively active ion channels. In the absence of ATP (but presence of MgATP), cardiac channels exhibit spontaneous bursts of rapid openings and closings (fast kinetics), which are separated by long closed intervals (slow kinetics). Conversely, ATP destabilizes channel open state and stabilizes its closed states by increasing the speed of gating. Found predominantly in cardiac smooth muscle, skeletal muscle smooth muscle, neurons and ovaries. Gating of the atrial K+ channel is mechanosensitive, and mechanical pressure applied to a cardiac cell leads to an increase in their activity.	The four Kir6.2/KCNJ11 subunits form the K+ channel with the ABCC9/SUR2A subunits attached round the outside of the channel by interaction of their respective N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic loops. These form a beta sheet that acts as a gating regulator. There are three different SUR subunits, SUR1 (ABCC8), SUR2A and SUR2B (ABCC9 isoforms 1 and 2). SUR1 channels are approximately 4-fold more ATP-sensitive than SUR2 channels.	-	MgATP (CHEBI:30617)|ATP (CHEBI:15422)|ADP (CHEBI:16761)|MgADP (CHEBI:87194)	Dilated cardiomyopathy [EFO:0000407]: Decreased function of the heart associated with cardiac enlargement and congestive heart failure.|Ischemic preconditioning (= transient ischemic attack) [EFO:0003764]: Brief episodes of ischemia resulting in subsequent protection of the myocardium against later, more severe ischemic insult.|Ventricular arrhythmia (= ventricular fibrillation) [EFO:0004287]: A potentially lethal cardiac arrhythmia that is characterized by uncoordinated extremely rapid firing of electrical impulses (400-600/min) in heart venticles.

A cation-specific, but otherwise relatively non-selective, ion channel with low conductance. Ca2+-permeability is related to subunit composition with 5HT3A homopentamers being more permeable than 5HT3A/B heteropentamers. Found pre- and post-synaptically but with different properties - pre-synaptic 5-HT3 receptors are predominantly calcium-permeant while post-synaptic receptors are permeant to Na+ and K+. Also Mg2+ permeant. Pre-synaptic depolarisations are generally slower than post-synaptic depolarisations. 5-HT3 receptors increase the frequency of spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs) or miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs). These may be related to 5-HT3-induced depolarisation of pre-synaptic membranes and subsequent activation of cholinergic or glutamatergic neurotransmissions or evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents (eEPSCs) or spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSCs) related to GABAergic neurotransmissions post-synaptic 5-HT3 receptor activation. Due to different residues in transmembrane domain M2 of the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits the 5-HT3A/B heteromeric receptors are more efficient conductors than 5-HT3A homomeric receptors and have increased agonist and antagonist affinity. Homomeric receptors recover faster from desensitisation but are probably less prevalent in vivo. High levels of expression are found in the vagal terminals of the dorsal vagal complex where it is involved in the vomiting reflex (especially post-operative and chemotherapy- and radiation-induced vomiting and nausea), in the amygdala and the hippocampi. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists therefore act as effective anti-emetic drugs. Lower levels of expression are found in the forebrain with higher relative expression in the striatum than the cortical regions. Involved in processes associated with emotion, cognition, memory and pain perception. Involved in ganglionic transmission in the myenteric plexus in the mucosal layer and expressed in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract where serotonin mediates control over a variety of physiological functions such as the contraction/relaxation of smooth muscle, and peristaltic and secretory reflexes, directly or indirectly through intrinsic primary afferent neurons. Plays an important role in the regulation of inflammation and immune responses in the peripheral nervous system. Activation of 5-HT3 receptors on visceral afferents in some irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients results in visceral hypersensitivity. Chaperone proteins assist assembly, modifications and export from the ER followed by transport in vesicle-like structures along microtubules to the plasma membrane where they typically form clusters in F-actin-rich regions.	Pentamer that forms a central channel. Each subunit consists of a large, N-terminal, extracellular domain, four transmembrane (TM) domains (M1-M4), of which M2 lines the channel, as well as intra- and extracellular loops connecting the TM domains and an extracellular C-terminus. Cation selectivity is determined by the M2 TM domain as well as the cytoplasmic M3-M4 loop while conductance efficiency is related to residues in the M3-M4 loop. The 5-HT3A subunits, at least, are N-glycosylated and phosphorylated in the cytoplasmic M3-M4 loop. The 5-HT3A subunit exists as different splice variants in different mammalian species, some of which are only functional in complex with canonical chains. In the 5-HT3A/B heteromer, the 5-HT3A shields the ER-retention signal of the 5-HT3B subunit allowing export of the heteromeric complex from the ER to the plasma membrane.	-	serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, CHEBI:28790)	Schizophrenia [EFO:0000692]: A severe emotional disorder of psychotic depth characteristically marked by a retreat from reality with delusion formation, HALLUCINATIONS, emotional disharmony, and regressive behaviour.|Depression [EFO:0003761]: Severe mental disorder with onset in MIDDLE AGE, marked by withdrawl, abnormal affect, disturbed intellectual processes, and there may be regression.|Bipolar disorder [EFO:0000289]: A major affective disorder marked by severe mood swings (manic or major depressive episodes) and a tendency to remission and recurrence.|Post-operative nausea and vomiting [EFO:0004888]: Emesis and queasiness occurring after anesthesia.|Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting [EFO:0006911]: Emesis and queasiness occurring after chemotherapy.|Radiation-induced nausea and vomiting [EFO:0006912]: Emesis and queasiness occurring after radiotherapy.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

Through its interaction with VWF immobilized at the damaged blood vessel wall, the GPIb-IX-V complex mediates the initial tethering and rolling of circulating platelets to the injury site. The rolling reduces platelet velocity and prolongs the contact time with components of the cell matrix, facilitating platelet activation and subsequent integrin-mediated firm attachment.

Consequently, a reduction in the internalisation of circulating low density lipoproteins (LDLs) occurs, leading to high plasma levels of LDLs, causing familial hypercholesterolemia type 3. Formation of the complex interferes with an acid-dependent conformational change of LDLR required for receptor recycling via the endosome. Instead, PCSK9 binding to LDLR can induce its ubiquitination leading to rerouteing of LDLR to the lysosome where it is degraded.	After auto-cleavage of PCSK9 at 152Gln, its pro-domain (Pro) remains tightly associated with its subtilisin-like catalytic domain (Cat) and both are bound to LDLR.

Exhibits weak selectivity for potassium over sodium ions and contributes to the native pacemaker currents in heart (If) and in neurons (Ih). Together with HCN4 (Q9Y3Q4, EBI-10814846), HCN2 is the dominant form of HCN expressed in the heart. Produces a large instantaneous current. Modulated by intracellular chloride ions and pH; acidic pH shifts the activation to more negative voltages. Contrary to other ion-gated channels, HCN channels do not require an accessory unit but depolarisation activity is affected by optional accessory proteins such as TRIP8b (PEX5L, Q8IYB4) or lipids such as phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate.	Each HCN2 subunit contains a transmembrane domain (TMD), similar to other voltage-gated K+ channels, and a C-terminal cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD). Tetramerisation and cAMP binding is both facilitated through the C-terminal linker (between the last TMD and the CNBD) and the CNBD itself.

Activated under low extracellular sodium concentrations and low extracellular pH and self-inhibited by high extracellular sodium concentrations. Activation is dependent on proteolytic cleavage of alpha and gamma subunits, post-translational modifications (such as glycosylation of beta subunit and palmitoylation) and possibly cyclic nucleotides that lift self-inhibition. Regulated by hormones such as aldosterone and vasopressin and inhibited by the diuretic amiloride. Although the channel activity itself is not voltage-gated, ameloride-sensitivity may be voltage-dependent. Channel gating and conductance are comparatively slow. Plays an essential role in electrolyte and blood pressure homeostasis, but also in airway surface liquid (ASL) homeostasis, which is important for proper clearance of mucus and pathogens. Mutations leading to a loss of ASL homeostatis are a trigger for cystic fibrosis. The inward sodium transport may trigger action potentials in neurons by gradually depolarizing membrane potentials. In nephrons may also be activated by shear stress potentially changing the conformation of the bulky extracellular loop or the transmembrane domains and thereby increasing channel opening times. May also play a role in salt and sour taste perception. Found in the apical membrane of many epithelial cell types, especially in the Aldosterone Sensitive Distal Nephron (ASDN), kidney, colon, lung and sweat glands but also in heart, liver, pancreas, skeletal muscle and blood leukocytes. Also expressed in vascular endothelia where their mechanical properties and function differ from epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) in other tissues: vascular endothelia are ‘leaky’, allowing passive sodium transport through the membrane. Here, ENaCs are activated by increased external sodium concentrations that enhances the sodium influx into the cell. May stabilize F-actin through strengthening of the inter-subunits causing swelling or stiffening of endothelia and which can ultimately lead to hypertension. 	The beta and gamma subunits regulate the channel activity, the alpha and delta subunits regulate channel conductance. Transmembrane domain (TM) 1 lines the plasma membrane, TM2 lines the channel. 	-	-	Pseudohypoaldosteronism type I (PHA1) [Orphanet:756]: a primary form of mineralocorticoid resistance presenting in the newborn with renal salt wasting, failure to thrive and dehydration.

Caused by truncations of or mutation in PY motif of beta or gamma subunits leading to constitutive activation of the renal epithelial sodium channel. The PY motif contains the E3 ligase interaction site that is essential for the ubiquination and degradation of subunits. Constitutive activation of the epithelial sodium channel can also be caused by high dietary salt intake or excessive licorice consumption.|Hypertension [EFO:0000537]: persistently high systemic arterial blood pressure. Based on multiple readings, hypertension is currently defined as when systolic pressure is consistently greater than 140 mm Hg or when diastolic pressure is consistently 90 mm Hg or more. Loss of epithelial sodium channel self-inhibition activity under high sodium conditions leads to salt-sensitive hypertension [MP:0004217]: sustained high blood pressure that is maintained with the amount of salt consumed in the diet; blood pressure may return to normotensive with a low salt diet.|Cystic fibrosis (CF) [Orphanet:586]: an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the production of sweat with a high salt content and mucus secretions with an abnormal viscosity due to airway surface liquid (ASL) dehydration. As the mucus traps particles and pathogens a lack of regular mucus clearance in patients can lead to serious lung infections. The disease is chronic and generally progressive, with onset usually occurring during early childhood or, occasionally, at birth (meconium ileus). Virtually any internal organ may be involved but the principle manifestations concern the breathing apparatus (chronic bronchitis), pancreas (pancreatic insufficiency, adolescent diabetes and occasionally pancreatitis) and, more rarely, the intestine (stercoral obstruction) or liver (cirrhosis). The most common form of cystic fibrosis is associated with respiratory symptoms, digestive problems (steatorrhea and/or constipation), elevated sweat electrolytes and staturoponderal growth anomalies. Mortality and morbidity depend on the extent of bronchopulmonary involvement. Male sterility is a constant feature. Late-onset forms, which are usually only mild or monosymptomatic, have also been reported. Characterized by alterations in the CFTR protein (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, P13569). The absence of the CFTR in apical membranes causes epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) hyperactivity, excessive sodium absorption, ASL dehydration and acidification of the extracellular space leading to lung infections. SPLUNC1 negatively regulates ENaC activity and therefore maintains normal ASL homeostasis. Under ASL dehydration and acidic conditions this interaction is abolished.|Bronchiectasis [HP:0002110]: a bronchial disease that is a chronic inflammatory condition of one or more bronchi or bronchioles marked by dilatation and loss of elasticity of the walls resulting from damage to the airway wall leading to the formation of small sacs on the bronchial wall and impairment of cilia mobility in the lung. Inflammation of the bronchial wall increases mucus secretion which serves as a breeding ground for bacteria. Bronchiectasis is caused by repeated respiratory infections, immune deficiency disorders, hereditary disorders (cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary dyskinesia), mechanical factors (inhaled object or a lung tumor) or inhaling toxic substances.	-	amiloride (CHEBI:2639)|zinc ion (Zn2+, CHEBI:29105)	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

Exhibits weak selectivity for potassium over sodium ions and contributes to the native pacemaker currents in heart (If) and in neurons (Ih). Contrary to other ion-gated channels, HCN channels do not require an accessory unit but depolarisation activity is affected by optional accessory proteins such as TRIP8b (PEX5L, Q8IYB4) or lipids such as phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate.

Activated by binding of MgADP or MgATP to the nucleotide binding domains (NBD) of the ABCC8/SUR1 subunit as well as extracellular K+ binding to the KCNJ11/Kir6.2 subunit. If MgATP binds it must first get hydrolised by the ATP hydrolysis activity of the NBD which also generates PtdIns(4,5)P2 from phosphatidylinositol. Channel activation possibly driven by conformational changes resulting from MgADP binding to SUR subunits and reducing ATP affinity to Kir6.2. Inhibited by intracellular ATP or ADP, Mg2+ and polyamines that bind to the Kir6.2 subunits. ATP/ADP probably changes the conformation of Kir6.2 while Mg2+ and polyamines physically block the flow of K+ through the channel pore. Also inhibited by exogenous sulfonylureas by binding to intracellular loops (possibly by displacing MgADP from NBDs) and used to treat diabetic disorders. As ATP is a weak inhibitor Kir6.2 channels can open spontaneously and are classified as constitutively active ion channels. In the absence of ATP (but presence of MgATP), cardiac and pancreatic channels exhibit spontaneous bursts of rapid openings and closings (fast kinetics), which are separated by long closed intervals (slow kinetics). Conversely, ATP destabilizes channel open state and stabilizes its closed states by increasing the speed of gating. Found predominantly in pancreatic beta-cells where glucose metabolism leads to an increase in intracellular ATP and a concomitant fall in MgADP causing closure of K+ channels, membrane depolarization and opening of voltage-gated calcium channels which ultimately triggers insulin release.	The four Kir6.2/KCNJ11 subunits form the K+ channel with the ABCC8/SUR1 subunits attached round the outside of the channel by interaction of their respective N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic loops. These form a beta sheet that acts as a gating regulator. There are three different SUR subunits, SUR1 (ABCC8), SUR2A and SUR2B (ABCC9 isoforms 1 and 2). SUR1 channels are approximately 4-fold more ATP-sensitive than SUR2 channels.	-	MgADP (CHEBI:87194)|MgATP (CHEBI:30617)|ATP (CHEBI:15422)|ADP (CHEBI:16761)	Diabetes, type II [EFO:0001360]: A type of diabetes mellitus that is characterized by insulin resistance or desensitization and increased blood glucose levels.

Caused by loss-of-function mutations in KCNJ11/Kir6.2 and/of ABCC8/SUR1 subunits of the pancreatic K+ channel resulting in either defects of K+ channel trafficking to the surface membrane or disruption of channel gating by nucleotides ultimately causing permanent activity of the voltage-gated calcium channel leading to permanent insulin secretion and hypoglycemia.|neonatal diabetes mellitus with reduced insulin secretion and resultant hyperglycemia [Orphanet:224]: Neonatal diabetes mellitus presents as hyperglycemia, delayed development of speech and walking and muscle weakness and, in some cases, dehydration and ketoacidosis which may be severe with coma, in a child within the first months of life. Includes Transient (TNDM) [Orphanet:99886] and Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) [Orphanet:99885]. TNDM infants develop diabetes in the first few weeks of life but go into remission in a few months, with possible relapse to a permanent diabetes state usually around adolescence or as adults. The pancreatic dysfunction may be maintained throughout life, with relapse initiated at times of metabolic stress such as puberty or pregnancy. In PNDM, insulin secretory failure occurs in the late fetal or early post-natal period, does not go into remission and requires continuous insulin treatment.

CSNK1A1 phosphorylates CTNNB1 on Ser-45 and primes successive phosphorylation of Thr-41, Ser-37, and Ser-33 by GSK3. Phosphorylation of CTNNB1 promotes its subsequent ubiquitination which targets the protein for degradation by the proteasome. Without Wnt, Axin is also phosphorylated by GSK3, and thereby kept in an active (‘open’) conformation for beta-catenin binding and degradation. Upon Wnt stimulation, the ternary WNT-FZ-LRP6 complex is formed and recruits the scaffold protein DVL and the beta-catenin destruction complex. As a result, GSK3 is inhibited, CTNNB1 is not ubiquitinated and accumulates in the nucleus, where it acts as a coactivator for transcription factors of the TCF/LEF family, leading to activation of Wnt responsive genes.

It is involved in various processes related to chromatin dynamics: DNA replication, DNA damage and repair, transcription initiation and elongation. Binds histone H2A-H2B dimers and possibly small amounts of H3H4. Facilitates RNAPol II driven transcription through chromatin by destabilizing nucleosomal structure so that one of the H2A-H2B dimers is removed upon RNA Pol II passage. Subsequently brings back the histones and thereby maintains nucleosome integrity after RNA Pol II passage. Interacts with the active forms of the MCM complexes facilitating its unwinding activity. 	The acidic C-terminus of the SPT16 subunit (933-1047aa) is essential for the FACT-nucleosome interaction. SSRP1 residues 547-615 bind to DNA. Based on purification yields, it has been estimated that there are more than 100,000 molecules of FACT complex per cell.

A cation-specific, but otherwise relatively non-selective, ion channel with low conductance. Ca2+-permeability is related to subunit composition with 5HT3A homopentamers being more permeable than 5HT3A/B heteropentamers. Found pre- and post-synaptically but with different properties - pre-synaptic 5-HT3 receptors are predominantly calcium-permeant while post-synaptic receptors are permeant to Na+ and K+. Also Mg2+ permeant. Pre-synaptic depolarisations are generally slower than post-synaptic depolarisations. 5-HT3 receptors increase the frequency of spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs) or miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs). These may be related to 5-HT3-induced depolarisation of pre-synaptic membranes and subsequent activation of cholinergic or glutamatergic neurotransmissions or evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents (eEPSCs) or spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSCs) related to GABAergic neurotransmissions post-synaptic 5-HT3 receptor activation. 5-HT3E subunits are exclusively expressed in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract where serotonin mediates control over a variety of physiological functions such as the contraction/relaxation of smooth muscle, and peristaltic and secretory reflexes, directly or indirectly through intrinsic primary afferent neurons. Plays an important role in the regulation of inflammation and immune responses in the peripheral nervous system. Activation of 5-HT3 receptors on visceral afferents in some irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients results in visceral hypersensitivity. Chaperone proteins assist assembly, modifications and export from the ER followed by transport in vesicle-like structures along microtubules to the plasma membrane where they typically form clusters in F-actin-rich regions.	Pentamer that forms a central channel. Each subunit consists of a large, N-terminal, extracellular domain, four transmembrane (TM) domains (M1-M4), of which M2 lines the channel, as well as intra- and extracellular loops connecting the TM domains and an extracellular C-terminus. Cation selectivity is determined by the M2 TM domain as well as the cytoplasmic M3-M4 loop while conductance efficiency is related to residues in the M3-M4 loop. The 5-HT3A subunits, at least, are N-glycosylated and phosphorylated in the cytoplasmic M3-M4 loop. The 5-HT3A subunit exists as different splice variants in different mammalian species, some of which are only functional in complex with canonical chains.	-	serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, CHEBI:28790)	Schizophrenia [EFO:0000692]: A severe emotional disorder of psychotic depth characteristically marked by a retreat from reality with delusion formation, HALLUCINATIONS, emotional disharmony, and regressive behaviour.|Depression [EFO:0003761]: Severe mental disorder with onset in MIDDLE AGE, marked by withdrawl, abnormal affect, disturbed intellectual processes, and there may be regression.|Bipolar disorder [EFO:0000289]: A major affective disorder marked by severe mood swings (manic or major depressive episodes) and a tendency to remission and recurrence.|Post-operative nausea and vomiting [EFO:0004888]: Emesis and queasiness occurring after anesthesia.|Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting [EFO:0006911]: Emesis and queasiness occurring after chemotherapy.|Radiation-induced nausea and vomiting [EFO:0006912]: Emesis and queasiness occurring after radiotherapy.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

Loss of epithelial sodium channel self-inhibition activity under high sodium conditions leads to salt-sensitive hypertension [MP:0004217]: sustained high blood pressure that is maintained with the amount of salt consumed in the diet; blood pressure may return to normotensive with a low salt diet.|Cystic fibrosis (CF) [Orphanet:586]: an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the production of sweat with a high salt content and mucus secretions with an abnormal viscosity due to airway surface liquid (ASL) dehydration. As the mucus traps particles and pathogens a lack of regular mucus clearance in patients can lead to serious lung infections. The disease is chronic and generally progressive, with onset usually occurring during early childhood or, occasionally, at birth (meconium ileus). Virtually any internal organ may be involved but the principle manifestations concern the breathing apparatus (chronic bronchitis), pancreas (pancreatic insufficiency, adolescent diabetes and occasionally pancreatitis) and, more rarely, the intestine (stercoral obstruction) or liver (cirrhosis). The most common form of cystic fibrosis is associated with respiratory symptoms, digestive problems (steatorrhea and/or constipation), elevated sweat electrolytes and staturoponderal growth anomalies. Mortality and morbidity depend on the extent of bronchopulmonary involvement. Male sterility is a constant feature. Late-onset forms, which are usually only mild or monosymptomatic, have also been reported. Characterized by alterations in the CFTR protein (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, P13569). The absence of the CFTR in apical membranes causes (epithelial sodium channel) ENaC hyperactivity, excessive sodium absorption, ASL dehydration and acidification of the extracellular space leading to lung infections. SPLUNC1 negatively regulates ENaC activity and therefore maintains normal ASL homeostasis. Under ASL dehydration and acidic conditions this interaction is abolished.|Bronchiectasis [HP:0002110]: a bronchial disease that is a chronic inflammatory condition of one or more bronchi or bronchioles marked by dilatation and loss of elasticity of the walls resulting from damage to the airway wall leading to the formation of small sacs on the bronchial wall and impairment of cilia mobility in the lung. Inflammation of the bronchial wall increases mucus secretion which serves as a breeding ground for bacteria. Bronchiectasis is caused by repeated respiratory infections, immune deficiency disorders, hereditary disorders (cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary dyskinesia), mechanical factors (inhaled object or a lung tumor) or inhaling toxic substances.	-	amiloride (CHEBI:2639)|zinc ion (Zn2+, CHEBI:29105)	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

Once autophagosome formation is completed, the autophagosome docks lysosomes in order to degrade cellular cargoes by fusion. At this point, the surrounding acidic condition drives ATG5 to change its binding partner from ATG16L1 to TECPR1. Binding of the ATG12-ATG5 conjugate to a region of TECPR1 frees an auto-inhibition of the PH domain within this protein. This domain is then freed to attach to a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate molecule of the autophagosomal membrane, thus tethering the autophagosome to a lysosome. These 2 vesicles will then undergo SNARE-mediated fusion to form an autolysosome.	ATG12 is constitutively conjugated to ATG5, via a glycyl-lysine isopeptide.	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

The IL23 ligand complex (EBI-9992716) binds the receptors chains IL12RB1 and IL23R which are associated with the kinases TYK2 and JAK2, respectively. Transphosphorylation of IL23R and the JAK-family kinases initiates the JAK-STAT signaling cascade via phosphorylation and heterodimerisation of STAT3 and STAT4 (P40763/Q14765). This ultimately leads to the activation of transcription of interferon-gamma or Interleukin-17.

Selectively cleaves the linkage between a glucuronic acid unit and an N-sulfo glucosamine unit of HSPGs carrying either a 3-O-sulfo, a 6-O-sulfo or a 2-O-sulfo group, but not linkages between a glucuronic acid unit and a 2-O-sulfated iduronic acid moiety. HS sulfation serves as a molecular signal that directs heparanase to cleave only certain glycan sites and acts as mechanistic handles by which the enzyme can prize open the substrate HS helix and more effectively access the trisaccharide cleavage site via heparanase-binding induced distortion of the substrate helix. Present in a variety of cellular locations where it performs an essential housekeeping role in catabolic processing of internalized HSPGs and at the cell surface or released into the ECM where it participates in ECM degradation and remodeling. HSPGs ensure that bioactive molecules such as growth factors, chemokines, lipoproteins, and enzymes are localized to the cell surface and ECM and function in the control of normal and pathological processes. These include morphogenesis, osteogenesis, hair follicle inner root sheath differentiation and hair homeostasis, wound healing, shedding of syndecans, inflammation, pre-eclampsia, autoimmunity, cell proliferation and migration associated with metastasis, endothelial invasion and angiogenesis. Cleavage of HSPGs is likely to release these regulators that can alter the functional state of tissues and provide a mechanism by which cells can respond rapidly to changes in the extracellular environment. The proliferative advantages conferred by heparanase lead to its up-regulation in tumors in a variety of tissues, and its over-expression correlates strongly with metastasis and worsened clinical prognoses. Also acts as pro-coagulant by increasing the generation of activation factor X in the presence of tissue factor and activation factor VII. Increases cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) independent of its enzymatic activity. HPSE is the only mammalian gene so far identified to have heparanase activity. 	Secreted as a latent enzyme and internalized into late endosomes or lysosomes where it is subjected to proteolytic cleavage and activation. Cleavage at Glu109-Ser110 and Gln157-Lys158 yields an N-terminal 8 kDa and a C-terminal 50 kDa polypeptide that combine to form the catalytic site. Subsequent exocytosis transports the heparanase to its target sites. Prior to cleavage, the linker between the the 8 kD and 50 kD proteolytic chains acts as a steric block. Residues Glu-225 and Glu-343, located in the catalytic cleft, are crucial for its heparanase activity having been identified as the catalytic nucleophile and acid-base of HPSE.

NoRC is targeted to rDNA by the interaction of its subunit BAZ2A with TTF1 [P43699] bound to the promoter-proximal target site. NoRC also binds to 150-300 nt RNAs that are complementary to the rDNA promoter (transcripts originating from the intergenic spacer that separates rRNA genes). NoRC remodels nucleosomes at the rDNA promoter and recruits histone deacetylases (e.g. Hdac1, Hdac2), histone methyltransferase and DNA methyltransferases (e.g. Dnmt1, Dnmt3b) leading to heterochromatin formation and transcriptional silencing. The interaction of NoRC with the short RNA transcripts is mediated by the TAM domain of BAZ2A and it is required for NoRC binding to chromatin and heterochromatin formation. 	BAZ2A, the largest subunit of the NoRC complex, has the following domains important for the complex function: MBD (methyl-CpG-binding) / TAM domain is a DNA binding region and PHD finger/Bromodomain at the c-terminus that interacts with the acetylated histone H4K16.	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

Components of the plasminogen activation system including urokinase (uPA) and its cell surface receptor (uPAR) have been implicated in a wide variety of biological processes related to tissue homoeostasis. Activated uPA cleaves the zymogen plasminogen, generating the protease plasmin. uPA and plasmin induces a potent negative feedback on cell adhesion through specific cleavage of the RGD motif in vitronectin. Cleavage of vitronectin by uPA requires concomitant binding of both uPA and vitronectin to uPAR. 	uPAR binds simultaneously to uPA and the somatomedin B domain (SMB) of vitronectin. uPA binding to uPAR is mediated by a 25-residue beta-turn growth factor-like (EGF) domain that is ensconced in a large hydrophobic cavity lined with several residues that contribute more than an order of magnitude to the binding. SMB binds to the outer side of the receptor. The uPAR-uPA interaction is a tight approximately1 nM and long-lived complex that occurs over a large protein-protein interface of more than 1,000 A2. In contrast, the uPAR-VTN interaction occurs over a smaller interface of 75A. The binding of the SMB domain is a transient interaction with micromolar affinity that is uPA-dependent despite the lack of direct interaction between uPA and VTN.
